We will create a polymorphic association so that this comment model can be used with any numbers of models.


class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true
end




class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable
end


And can create a common view file:
<% f.fields_for :comments do |comment_form| %>
  <li>
    <%= comment_form.label :content %>
           <%= comment_form.text_area :content %>
         </li>
<% end %>


And use it anywhere we like.


And if there is any common model code in that case we can simply create a module or concern and use it any number of models:


module Commentable
end


Pros: We don't have to rewrite the same functionality again and again, we can simply reuse it.

Cons: The only con I can see is that whatever you do for one will be applied to all others.
