You have a model that needs to send data to a 3rd party API after it is saved. How
would you accomplish this? (Please provide a code example.) What are the pros/cons of your approach?

Ans: 
In models i will write
after_commit :send_data


def send_data
  TransferBusinessData.perform(data)
end


class TransferBusinessData < ApplicationJob
  def perform(data)
    Mekari.send_business_info(data)
  end
end


In lib folder


class Mekari
  include HTTParty


  def self.send_business_info(data)
    post('url', body: data.to_json, headers:          {'Content-Type' => 'application/json'})
  end
end


Pros: The request time of the action will decrease significantly if we follow this approach..
cons: This approach is not good if the data needs to be synchronized at the current moment because this approach can have delays in sending data.
