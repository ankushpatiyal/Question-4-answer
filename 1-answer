First I will use a profiler to find out the root cause of the slowness of the controller action.
Second i will try these below steps:
1. The data that we are fetching in this action can be the cause of the slowness. In that case I will try to optimize the query.
2. Try to use cache anywhere possible.
3. If there is anything that can be done even after action is rendered then i will try to run that code in Delayed job.
