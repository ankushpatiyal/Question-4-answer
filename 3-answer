The issue here is that we are not eager loading user table that can result in n+1 queries.

Solution to the above issue: 
â€”----------------------------------------------------------
If mention table is only associated with message then we can simply query:
Mention.joins(:user).where(user: {username: params[:username]})
otherwise we can write it like this:
Message.joins(mentions: :user).where("user.username = ?", params[:username])
